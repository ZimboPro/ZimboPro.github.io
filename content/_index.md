# Welcome

Welcome to my blog where I will share things I learnt as life progresses.

## Who am I?

I am Leslie de Jager and I have been working in the software industry since 2019. I am a tech enthusiast and enjoying learning new things and skills. 

I enjoy all things related to technology (for the most part) amongst other things such as woodworking.

## Why create a blog and what will it be about?  

The main reason for creating this blog is mainly to share but also to document the things I have learnt. This could be coding, programming techniques, 3D printers, IOT and more. I might also share my opinion on some things but only the future will tell.
